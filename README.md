# About

The script converts the ARM64 instruction encodings guide, issued by ARM, from a human-readable HTML to a machine-readable JSON. Tested on version 00bet6.1.

To run the script, you need:

* Python 2.7
* lxml for Python

I tested the script on MacOS, but it _probably_ works on Windows and Linux as well.

# How to use

Clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kov4l3nko/ARM64JSON.git
```

Create a folder inside, e.g. `arm_specs/`. Download the ARM64 encoding guide from the developer ARM site to the folder, unpack the archive:

```
$ cd ARM64JSON
$ mkdir arm_specs
$ cd arm_specs/
$ wget https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/pdf/A64_v83A_ISA_xml_00bet6.1.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf A64_v83A_ISA_xml_00bet6.1.tar.gz
```

Create a new folder for a JSON, e.g. `my_arm54_json`:

```
$ mkdir ../my_arm64_json
```

Generate the JSON by running `html2json.py` from `scripts/` folder:

```
$ cd ../scripts
$ python html2json.py ../arm_specs/ISA_v83A_A64_xml_00bet6.1/xhtml/ ../my_arm64_json/ARM64_v83A_A64_00bet6.1.json
```

That's it. 

# Example

See `example/` folder for a sample JSON generated by the script.
